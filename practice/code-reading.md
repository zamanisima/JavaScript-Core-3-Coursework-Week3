# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.
This is because of the scope differences. In line 4 x is local variable of function f1 and in line 6 x is a global variable which defined in line 1.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
This will log 10 and then throw an error, x is a global variable and y is within scope of the function and cannot be used outside of it.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
First console.log is going to be value 9 as const x passed to the function is not going to be changed.
Second console.log is going to be { x: 10 } as value of the key x in the object can be changed using reference.
